            <h2>What is Computer Hardware?</h2>
            <p>Computer hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system. These are the tangible parts that you can touch and see. The major hardware components include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</li>
                <li>Motherboard</li>
                <li>Memory (RAM)</li>
                <li>Storage Devices (HDD, SSD)</li>
                <li>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</li>
                <li>Input Devices (Keyboard, Mouse)</li>
                <li>Output Devices (Monitor, Printer)</li>
                <li>Peripheral Devices (External Storage, Networking Components)</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h3>
                <p>The CPU is often referred to as the "brain" of the computer. It performs calculations and executes instructions to run programs.</p>
                <h3>Motherboard</h3>
                <p>The motherboard is the main circuit board that houses the CPU, memory, and other essential components. It provides the connections and sockets for other hardware components.</p>
                <h3>Memory (RAM)</h3>
                <p>Random Access Memory (RAM) is the temporary storage that the CPU uses for processing tasks. It is volatile memory, meaning it loses its data when the computer is turned off.</p>
                <h3>Storage Devices</h3>
                <p>Hard Disk Drive (HDD): Uses spinning disks to read/write data.<br>
                Solid State Drive (SSD): Uses flash memory for faster data access.</p>
                <h3>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</h3>
                <p>Converts electrical power from an outlet into a usable form for the computer. Powers all the internal components.</p>
                <h3>Input Devices</h3>
                <p>Devices used to input data into the computer (e.g., keyboard, mouse).</p>
                <h3>Output Devices</h3>
                <p>Devices used to output data from the computer (e.g., monitor, printer).</p>
                <h3>Peripheral Devices</h3>
                <p>Additional devices that provide extra functionality (e.g., external hard drives, network cards).</p>

            <h2>Computer Basics: Inside a Computer</h2>
            <p>Understanding the internal components of a computer is crucial for comprehending how it works. Hereâ€™s a look inside a typical computer case:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Motherboard</li>
                <li>CPU</li>
                <li>RAM</li>
                <li>Storage</li>
                <li>Power Supply</li>
                <li>Expansion Cards</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="content hidden">
                <h3>Motherboard</h3>
                <p>The central hub where all other components connect. Contains slots for the CPU, RAM, and expansion cards.</p>
                <h3>CPU</h3>
                <p>Installed on the motherboard. Covered with a heat sink and fan to prevent overheating.</p>
                <h3>RAM</h3>
                <p>Installed in the RAM slots on the motherboard. Determines the system's ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.</p>
                <h3>Storage</h3>
                <p>Hard Disk Drives (HDDs): Larger capacity, slower access speeds.<br>
                Solid State Drives (SSDs): Smaller capacity, faster access speeds.</p>
                <h3>Power Supply</h3>
                <p>Supplies power to all components. Typically located at the top or bottom of the case.</p>
                <h3>Expansion Cards</h3>
                <p>Installed in PCI slots on the motherboard. Include graphics cards, sound cards, network cards, etc.</p>
